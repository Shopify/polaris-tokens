## Generating the design tokens

In a terminal, paste the following instructions.

With `dev` (Shopify employees):

```
dev clone polaris-tokens
dev up
dev start
```

Without `dev` (external contributors), with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```
git clone https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-tokens.git
cd polaris-tokens
yarn
yarn dist
```

Tokens are exported under the `dist/` folder for consumption by external projects:

```
color-filters.color-map.scss
color-filters.common.js
color-filters.custom-properties.css
color-filters.json
color-filters.map.scss
color-filters.raw.json

## Developing with the watch mode

In watch mode, the [documentation](https://shopify.github.io/polaris-tokens/) automatically live reloads at <http://localhost:3000>
when design tokens files (`./tokens/*.yml`) are edited.

```
dev server
```

or, if you donâ€™t have `dev` on your machine:

```
yarn watch
```

---

## Running the tests

This project uses [Jest snapshot testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html) to test the output of design tokens files in `./dist` generated from the YAML source files from `./tokens`.

Tests are located in the [`__tests__`](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-tokens/tree/master/__tests__) folder.

### Running tests once

```
yarn test
```

### Running tests on every file change

When developing or refactoring, running tests continuously can be a great time saver.

This command will run the test suite every time a file change is detected:

```
yarn test-watch
```

### Updating snapshots

Snapshots can become out of date (for example, after an update was made to any of the `./tokens/*.yml` files), and need to be updated for the test to pass:

```
yarn test -u
```

---

## Editing design tokens

Design tokens source files are in the `./tokens` directory, in YAML format.

Adding, removing, and updating design tokens should be discussed in the issues of this project before contributing to code changes.
