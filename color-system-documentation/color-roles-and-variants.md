# Color roles and variants

Instead of referring to the colors in the system by their hue or Hex value, such as #E5E5E5, we refer to them by the role that they play in the UI.

Color roles are variables that can be used to apply the base theme or a custom color theme to multiple areas at once, in a purposeful way. Each color role has a light and a dark version that applies depending on whether the interface is being viewed in light or dark mode.

The color variants for corresponding UI elements are categorized so that their names reflect their compatibility. For example, “action primary” (the color for a primary button) and “text on primary” (the color for the text on a primary button) go together. When color variants are applied intentionally, their values help to establish visual hierarchy, ensure accessible contrast, and distinguish UI elements and surfaces from one another.
