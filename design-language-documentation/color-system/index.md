# Color system

As a part of our design language, we use colors purposefully to establish brand presence and to communicate the interactive state, hierarchy, and emphasis of elements on the screen. The color palette is optimized for contrast between different kinds of elements, and helps to ensure an accessible experience.

### Scalability

Instead of referring to the colors by their hue or Hex value, we refer to them by the role they play in the UI. This allows us to easily modify, customize, and extend the color system to work for any touchpoint at Shopify.

### Customizability

Color roles are variables that can be used to apply the base theme or a custom color theme to multiple areas at once, in a purposeful way. Each color has a light and a dark variant that applies depending on whether the interface is being viewed in light or dark mode.

### Intentionality

The colors for related UI elements have names that reflect their compatibility. For example, “action primary” (the color for a primary button) and “text on primary” (the color for the text on a primary button) go together. When color variants are applied intentionally, their values help to establish visual hierarchy, ensure accessible contrast, and distinguish UI elements and surfaces from one another.
