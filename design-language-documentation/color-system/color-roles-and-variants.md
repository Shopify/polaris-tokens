# Color roles and variants

Color roles and variants are the variables or tokens that make up the color system.

## Color roles

Color roles are variables that apply a theme to multiple areas at once, in a purposeful way. A theme is made up of 10 color roles, which are used to generate the values of all the color variants in the palette.

For the base theme, the values of the 10 color roles look like this:

## Color variants

Color variants are variables that apply color to the UI, and their values are generated from the color roles. Color variants are available as tokens.

The color variants make up all the colors in the palette. A few examples of color variants are:

- action primary
- icon critical
- surface success subdued
