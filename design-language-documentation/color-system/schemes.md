# Dark and light schemes

The Polaris color system provides 2 default schemes, one for light mode and one for dark mode. The following example shows surface colors in the two schemes:

<img alt="Surface colors in dark and light mode" src="/design-language-documentation/assets/schemes.png" style="max-height: 600px;">

Each generated color has the same hue in light and dark mode, only the lightness of the hue is adjusted. The page background and some surface colors change considerably, while the adjustment for other elements is more subtle. Color variants are adjusted to different degrees to convey depth and preserve visual hierarchy and harmony in the UI. The color system uses the [HSLuv color space](https://www.hsluv.org/) which allows us to adjust colors programmatically while maintaining accessible contrast.
