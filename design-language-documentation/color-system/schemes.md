# Dark and light schemes

The Polaris color system provides 2 default schemes, one for light mode and one for dark mode.

Color variants have the same hue in light and dark mode, only the lightness of the hue is adjusted. The page background and some surface colors change considerably, while the adjustment for other elements is more subtle. Color variants are adjusted to different degrees to convey depth, maintain accessible contrast, and preserve visual hierarchy and harmony in the UI.
