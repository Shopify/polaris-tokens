# Shopify's design language [WIP]

_...to express ourselves in a familiar way, across contexts, so our audiences experience one Shopify._

Shopify's design language helps designers and developers to create user interfaces that look familiar and feel like Shopify, while giving them the flexibility to be creative.

## Getting started with Shopify's design language

As a part of our design language, we use colors purposefully to establish brand presence and to communicate the interactive state, hierarchy, and emphasis of elements on the screen. The color palette is optimized for contrast between different kinds of elements, and helps to ensure an accessible experience.

Instead of referring to the colors by their hue or Hex value, we refer to them by the role they play in the UI. This allows us to easily modify, customize, and extend the color system.

To update custom components (including forked components and Rails components with Sass that overrides default styling) see the following sections.
