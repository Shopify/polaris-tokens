# Shopify's design language [WIP]

_...to express ourselves in a familiar way across contexts so our audiences experience one Shopify_

Shopifyâ€™s design language helps teams to create products and experiences that look familiar and feel like Shopify, while giving them the flexibility to be creative. With the support of a solid foundation, we can empower teams to innovate more quickly.

The design language encompasses all the pieces that come together to help us express ourselves visually and verbally. These include:

- color
- voice and tone
- typography and spacing
- shape and depth
- illustration
- motion
- photography and videography
- icons

This documentation was created to support designers and developers in understanding and rolling out the design language internally.

- [Supporting design language rollout in the admin](https://vault.shopify.io/projects/11452)
